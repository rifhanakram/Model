Creating a market winning product requires a mammoth of additional knowledge and skills compared to software development. Product engineers
require a great sense of the domain and the market, product management techniques, customer engagement ability, superior engineering
capabilities, etc. Such skills are not taught at universities nor gained by engaging traditional software development work.

Majority of the global ISVs and Startups are heavily investing on digital first business services using Software Product geared for SaaS economy.
This market is forecasted to jump from 71B to 122B by 2025. Unfortunately, a major portion of the Software Products that are released into the
market never really reach its full potential and ROI due to fundamental issues in the approach. Therefore traditional ISVs with legacy products as
well as new Startups need a market winning product development formula covering all aspects of product development.



The Winning Product Canvas covers important strategic activities a team should consider from product ideation to retirement of the product. It is 
technology and platform agnostic and caters to ISVs/Startups covering different stages of product lifecycles to maximize the productâ€™s ability to stay 
ahead of competition. This framework covers disciplines such as User Experience, Product Marketing, Technology & Engineering, DevOps, Customer Support, etc.
