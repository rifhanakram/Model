description: "A referral is a trusted recommendation from another individual. As a business owner, customer engagement specialist, or marketer, you want to ensure that when people are asking about your services, your current customers are quick to recommend you.
Either people can agree or disagree, referrals are one of the most crucial components of a successful inbound sales strategy. In fact, there’s no more reliable way to grow any business than through sourcing referrals, but only if it's done in a systematic, smart way.

With a follow up system in place, you’ll know exactly when and how to ask your clients for referrals and actually get them. Because if you’re only asking clients for a review once after your sale and never again, you’re not tapping into this massive sales and growth engine. And unfortunately, it’s costing you serious revenue.

##why
Referral marketing works because everyone trusts the opinions of real people who have used a product or a service more than they trust traditional advertising. In fact researchers says that people are four times more likely to buy a product or service when it’s referred by a friend. While referrals usually come from friends and acquaintances, but now a days it doesn't have to be that only. In fact, influencer marketing is considered a form of referral marketing, as influencers often share their favorite products with followers via organic sharing and sponsored posts. Referral marketing can come from friends, influencers, celebrities, and even online reviews.
You can see good examples from TripAdvisor and Yelp and now Instagram
A well-organized referral program can help any small or midsize businesses get new, loyal customers at a very low price. These programs encourage happy customers to share their feelings in exchange for a small gift. Also a successful referral program will generate substantial and tangible ROI


##how(in bullet points)
When considering referral marketing we can identify customer and partner referral programs. Customer and partner referral programs can help bring new customers, partners, and even employees into your business. They can encourage happy customers to share their experiences. But how can you set up a program that gets results?

  - Product market fit
    - Without a strong Product Market Fit there are either no referrals in the first place.  Refer to product market fit in commercial viability in our model.
      If you don’t have Product Market Fit (PMF), you’re not ready for a Referral Marketing Program. If you do have PMF then what Value Exchange can you offer? This is one of the areas that can be tested and optimized so you can create multiple hypotheses here.

  - Trade or value exchange
    - A ‘value exchange’ between consumer and brand is one of the fundamentals of modern marketing; the basic transaction of swapping rich data for better experiences, as   a means of facilitating commercial transactions and improving connection and engagement. In fact, there are three stages that work together to create a ‘value         exchange’ between the brand and the customer.
 
      - The trading of money for goods or services.
      - The consumer sharing information in return for a reward.
      - The promise and delivery of a better consumer experience.

  - Social currency
    -  Social currency refers to the actual and potential resources from presence in social networks and communities, including both digital and offline. It is, in           essence, an action made by a company or stance of being, to which consumers feel a sense of value when associating with your brand, while the humanization of your     brand generates loyalty and "word of mouth" virality for the organization.
       Can you make the program really easy to be part of? Which is one of the arguments for using one of the software solutions out there.

  - Setting up goals
    -  If you decide to create a goal like referring X people, or earning Y points then making that goal not look like a stretch and more of a direct approach is             preferable. And being able to show and alert them progress along the way is essential.

      - Talk to your sales, account management, and support teams to find out how often referrals are made.
      - Consider what the average dollar value that each new customer brings into your business is.
      - Figure out how many referrals you'd need to sell to at least break even (compared to time and effort spent marketing, and managing the program).
      - Using break even point and a 10% conversion rate, calculate how many referrals your advocates would have to make to fuel your funnel.
