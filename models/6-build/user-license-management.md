##why
User license management is also used by software vendors to monitor and ensure compliance with the developer's software license. This helps prevent the developer's software from being copied, shared or otherwise illegally used (pirated) by non-licensed users. License management on the software vendor's side may also involve creating trial, personal, corporate and/or subscription-based license keys via a license generator; software product activation; product deactivation; and similar tasks.

##how
All software has a license attached, whether the program is a simple freeware tool or an expensive enterprise suite.
Here are the most common licensing types:
- Per device - it’s strictly meant to be used on a single machine.
- Per user - it’s restricted to one specific user who has to log in or otherwise confirm his or her identity for the license to be valid.
- Network - includes WAN and LAN; this licensing type, also called a concurrent license, covers all machines that are within a single specified network.
- Subscription - can refer to both user and device licenses and is managed by a subscription that usually has an expiry date.
- Cloud-based credits subscription - this is a sub-type of subscription hosted in the cloud.
- General public license (GPL) - covers so-called freeware and means the license and software come with no charge, and they can be used, shared, copied, and modified for free.
- Client access license (CAL) - refers to both device and user metrics and means that users can connect to a particular server and access software installed there.
- Capacity-based license - usually tied to certain configuration metrics, such as for a CPU, and is based on the capacity of the CPU, hard drive, or other hardware configuration elements.
- Font license - refers to specific fonts; some licenses may allow more types of use than others, and some are free.
- Freeware - means it’s free to use, but the creator holds the copyright.
