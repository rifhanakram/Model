##why

When you have a business idea, product, or service you would like to deliver to the market, the first thing to think about is that would this idea sell and make money? Like every other product, you inevitably encounter competitors at some point in your product life span. When you do, will your product/idea be able to compete and survive against these competitors? Or will your product fail due to market pressure? 
The art of making your product profitable, survivable in the face of competition and making it commercially sustainable in the long-run can be defined as the Commercial Viability. Commercial Viability includes but not limited to,
- Identifying your direct and indirect competitors
- Identifying your competitors' strengths and weaknesses
- Identifying your strengths and weaknesses
- Formulating a business plan which make you win the market over your competitors

##how

- Determine the level of commercially viable of a product or services by fulfilling the following requirements.
  - Product
    - How does the product solve the customers' problems, and which unique characteristics does it have?
  - Market
    - The size and nature of the market and why customers buy the idea?
  - Development
    - Overall practicality of the product. Will it work? Can it be made, and have you identified manufacturers/partners?
  - Feasibility
    - Do you have the skills, time, and money to bring the idea to market?
  - Financials
    - Will your sales exceed your expenses, and have you prepared cash flow projections?
